# Neural Network (NN) Model Comparison and Study for Credit Card Approval Evaluation

Neural network construction with a real-world credit card evaluation dataset

To execute the Neural Network (NN) model comparison program, used to compare the different hyperparameters of the MLPClassifier object used to create an NN for this problem domain of credict card approval determination, simply run the HeartPredStudy.py file. Navigate to this CI-Assignment-2 directory and execute the CC_NN_Study.py file, you can do so by running "python CC_NN_Study.py" in your terminal. The results will be outputted in the terminal or plots will be generated for the hidden layer, max iteration, and best performing MLP model tests, which will have to be closed for the program to resume running.
